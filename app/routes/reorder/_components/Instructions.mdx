Based on [Designing a reorderable list component][article] (without drag and drop). [See the code][article].

- Tab between the different tabbables on the page, the entire _Primary Tracks_ section is treated as a single tabbable area.
- Arrow up and down to move between tracks.
- Arrow left and right to move focus to track control.
- Don't be alarmed if results jump around, it just means someone else is also playing with the app at the same time.
